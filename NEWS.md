# RefineMod 0.1.0

RefineMod (0.1.0) is now available o be downloaded from GitHub! This package provides functionalities to optimize linear regression models. The functions may not be technically accurate for now... Hopefully will be refined to perform well. The package also only works on model objects generated by the `lm()` function.

Current key features of the package includes:

+ Identification of statistically significant predictors from set a input predictor variables for a linear regression model
+ Optimize a linear regression model to only those significant predictors
+ Compare the performance of lm models with different predictors

Refer to the package vignette to read more about the functions and their usage.
